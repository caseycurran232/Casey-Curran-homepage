    <p class="myP" >My name is Casey Curran and I am a third-year student at The Ohio State University. I am pursuing a double major in information systems and data analytics. In the future, I want to work as a consulstant for businesses looking for IT solutions. I am interested in the way that technology is constantly changing the business world and hope to be a helpful resource to many different clients. On campus, I am the finance chair of my fraternity, Alpha Sigma Phi. I manage the fraternity budget and collect dues from members. Additionally, I am a member of the Fisher Cares service club where I volunteer for organizations local to Columbus. Outside of school, I am currently an intern at STERIS, a medical manufacturing company, where I perform data analysis for internal clients. In the summer, I will be interning at Deloitte in an IT consulting role. </p>
